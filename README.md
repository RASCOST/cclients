# CClients
CClients was created in React-Native. I did it in the intent to build an application who let me have the contacts of the clients at work. 
I use my private phone at work, and I didn't wanted to fullfill and mix my contacts and work's contacts.
## CClienst is still under devellopment.
I can run it on my phone because I have an proper DB, it's not already able to create a self DB. I use sqlite3.
